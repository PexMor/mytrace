This directory contains historical documentation from the development process.

These files are kept for reference but are no longer part of the main documentation.

## Why Archive?

These documents were moved to the archive to:

1. **Focus documentation** - Main docs focus on current features and usage
2. **Reduce redundancy** - Avoid overlapping information
3. **Preserve history** - Keep implementation details for reference
4. **Improve navigation** - Easier to find relevant information

The information in these archived documents has been:

- **Consolidated** into comprehensive docs (AGENTS.md, development.md)
- **Summarized** in CHANGELOG.md for version history
- **Updated** to reflect current best practices

## Accessing Archive

These files are available in this directory for:

- **Contributors** - Understanding implementation history
- **Maintainers** - Reference for past decisions
- **Developers** - Learning about refactoring processes
- **AI Agents** - Context for code changes and evolution
