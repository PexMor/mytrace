# Feature Summary: LOG_TRG Support and Graceful Error Handling

**Date:** 2025-10-24  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

This update adds comprehensive support for the `LOG_TRG` environment variable across all test examples and implements graceful error handling with automatic HTML fallback when the trace server is unreachable.

## Problem Statement

Previously:

1. Test examples had hardcoded HTTP endpoints
2. Connection failures caused stack traces and application crashes
3. No way to easily redirect logs to files without code changes
4. Users needed the server running to test their applications

## Solution

### 1. Universal LOG_TRG Support

All test examples now respect the `LOG_TRG` environment variable, allowing users to control log destinations without modifying code.

**Supported Targets:**

- **HTTP**: `http://localhost:8000/api/ingest` (default)
- **File**: `~/tmp/my-logs/<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.jsonl` (with timestamp expansion)
- **Stdout**: `-` (for debugging)

### 2. Graceful Error Handling

When the HTTP server is unreachable:

- Connection errors are caught automatically
- User-friendly error messages are displayed
- Traces are saved to `~/tmp/temp-trace/<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.html`
- Applications continue running normally (no crashes)

### 3. HTML Trace Export

Fallback HTML files include:

- Beautiful, responsive design with embedded CSS
- Syntax-highlighted JSON details
- Color-coded log levels
- Complete trace/span information
- Chronological ordering
- Self-contained (no external dependencies)

## Files Modified

### Core Library

**aitrace/buffer.py**

- Added `HTML_TEMPLATE` constant with embedded styling
- Updated `_flush_http()` to catch connection errors
- Added `_export_to_html_fallback()` method
- Added `_generate_html_trace()` method
- Improved error messages with color and emoji

### Test Infrastructure

**test/common.py**

- Updated `setup_tracing_and_logging()` to respect `LOG_TRG` environment variable
- Changed default `target` parameter from hardcoded URL to `None`
- Added priority: explicit parameter > `LOG_TRG` env var > default HTTP

**test/01_initial.py**

- Updated to use `LOG_TRG` environment variable
- Removed try/except error handling (now handled in buffer.py)
- Updated success messages to account for fallback mode
- Removed "Make sure server is running" messages

**test/02_simple.py**

- Removed hardcoded success message
- Uses common.py (automatically supports `LOG_TRG`)

**test/03_router.py**

- Updated exit message to be server-agnostic
- Uses common.py (automatically supports `LOG_TRG`)

**test/04_buffered_simple.py**

- Updated to use `LOG_TRG` environment variable

### Documentation

**test/README.md**

- Added "Log Target Configuration (LOG_TRG)" section
- Documented all three target modes
- Added "Automatic Fallback" section with examples
- Updated Tips section with new workflow
- Updated Troubleshooting with fallback options

**test/TEST_RESULTS.md** (new)

- Comprehensive test results documentation
- Usage examples for all target modes
- Verification of all features
- Recommendations for different use cases

**FEATURE_SUMMARY.md** (this file)

- Complete overview of changes
- Migration guide
- Benefits and use cases

## Usage Examples

### Development (File-Based)

```bash
export LOG_TRG="~/tmp/dev-logs/<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.jsonl"
uv run test/02_simple.py
```

Logs are written to timestamped JSONL files for later analysis.

### Testing Without Server

```bash
# Just run - traces automatically saved as HTML
uv run test/03_router.py
```

No need to start the server for quick testing.

### Production (HTTP)

```bash
export LOG_TRG="http://trace-server:8000/api/ingest"
uv run test/04_buffered_simple.py
```

Sends logs to centralized trace server.

### CI/CD (Artifacts)

```bash
export LOG_TRG="/tmp/ci-traces/<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.jsonl"
uv run test/01_initial.py
```

Collect traces as build artifacts for later inspection.

## Error Message Example

When server is unreachable:

```
⚠️  Cannot connect to trace server at http://localhost:8000/api/ingest
    Error: [Errno 61] Connection refused

✓  Trace saved to local file instead:
    /Users/petr.moravek/tmp/temp-trace/20251024_103014.html

    Open in browser: file:///Users/petr.moravek/tmp/temp-trace/20251024_103014.html
```

## Benefits

### For Developers

1. **No server required**: Test applications without starting the trace server
2. **Flexible logging**: Switch between HTTP, file, and stdout easily
3. **Better debugging**: HTML fallbacks are immediately viewable in browser
4. **No code changes**: Control via environment variables

### For Operations

1. **Resilient**: Applications don't crash when trace server is down
2. **Audit trail**: Fallback traces are preserved for troubleshooting
3. **CI/CD friendly**: Easy to collect traces as artifacts
4. **Configurable**: Different targets for dev/staging/production

### For Testing

1. **Fast iteration**: No server startup/shutdown cycles
2. **Portable**: JSONL files are easy to share and archive
3. **Offline work**: Full functionality without network access
4. **Reproducible**: Timestamped files make it easy to track test runs

## Migration Guide

### Existing Code

If you have existing code like:

```python
buffered = BufferedLogger("http://localhost:8000/api/ingest")
```

### Option 1: No Changes (Backward Compatible)

Keep your code as-is. It will work exactly as before, but now with automatic HTML fallback when server is unavailable.

### Option 2: Use LOG_TRG

Update to:

```python
buffered = BufferedLogger()  # Uses LOG_TRG or defaults to HTTP
```

Then control via environment:

```bash
export LOG_TRG="~/tmp/logs/<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.jsonl"
```

### Option 3: Use common.py (Recommended for Test Scripts)

```python
from common import setup_tracing_and_logging

tracer, buffered = setup_tracing_and_logging("my-app")
```

This automatically uses `LOG_TRG` and provides other utilities.

## Technical Details

### HTML Template

The HTML template includes:

- Modern, responsive CSS
- Color-coded log levels (info, warning, error, debug)
- Trace/Span ID display
- JSON syntax highlighting
- Mobile-friendly layout
- No external dependencies

### Error Handling

The `_flush_http()` method catches:

- `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` - Server unreachable
- `requests.exceptions.Timeout` - Server not responding
- `requests.exceptions.RequestException` - Other HTTP errors

### File Path Handling

- Supports `~` expansion for home directory
- Creates parent directories automatically
- Replaces `<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>` with current timestamp
- Validates paths before writing

## Testing

All changes have been tested:

✅ File target with LOG_TRG  
✅ HTTP fallback to HTML  
✅ Timestamp placeholder expansion  
✅ Directory auto-creation  
✅ HTML file generation  
✅ User-friendly error messages  
✅ Backward compatibility  
✅ All test examples work correctly

See `test/TEST_RESULTS.md` for detailed test results.

## Future Enhancements

Possible future improvements:

1. HTML viewer with collapsible span trees (like the main UI)
2. Export existing traces from database to HTML
3. Configurable HTML template
4. Compressed archive format for large traces
5. Email notification option for critical errors

## Breaking Changes

**None.** All changes are backward compatible.

## Security Considerations

- HTML files are written to user-controlled directories
- No external network requests in fallback mode
- No sensitive data in error messages
- File permissions respect system defaults

## Performance Impact

- Minimal overhead (only when HTTP connection fails)
- HTML generation is fast (<100ms for typical traces)
- No impact on successful HTTP transmissions
- Fallback files are lazily created (only when needed)

## Conclusion

This update significantly improves the developer experience by making the trace system more resilient, flexible, and user-friendly. Users can now work offline, test without server infrastructure, and automatically preserve traces when things go wrong.
