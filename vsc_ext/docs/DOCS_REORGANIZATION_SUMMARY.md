│   ├── launch.json        ✅ Moved from root
│   └── tasks.json         ✅ Moved from root
```

### Files Created

1. **docs/user-guide.md** (~600 lines)
   - Installation and quick start
   - Loading and viewing traces
   - Configuration reference
   - All commands explained
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Usage examples and tips

2. **docs/development.md** (~450 lines)
   - Setup and prerequisites
   - Development workflow
   - Project structure
   - Building and testing
   - Debugging guide
   - Packaging and publishing
   - Code guidelines

3. **docs/DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md**
   - Documentation organization principles
   - Target audiences
   - Cross-reference strategy
   - Maintenance guidelines

### Files Modified

1. **README.md** - Simplified
   - Reduced from ~350 lines to ~120 lines
   - Brief feature overview
   - Quick start guide
   - Links to detailed docs
   - Configuration summary only

2. **AGENTS.md** - Enhanced formatting
   - Fixed table formatting
   - Improved readability
   - Added spacing for sections
   - Maintained all architectural content

3. **docs/development.md**
   - Updated project structure diagram
   - Reflected .vscode/ folder

4. **docs/DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md**
   - Updated file structure diagram

### Files Deleted

1. **SETUP.md** - Content moved to `docs/development.md`
2. **IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md** - Temporary status file, no longer needed

### Files Moved

1. **launch.json** → `.vscode/launch.json`
2. **tasks.json** → `.vscode/tasks.json`

## Rationale

### Why docs/ Folder?

- **Separation of concerns**: User vs. developer documentation
- **Reduced clutter**: Root level stays minimal
- **Scalability**: Easy to add more docs without overwhelming root
- **Standard practice**: Follows common open-source conventions

### Why Keep 3 Files in Root?

**README.md**
- Entry point for all users
- Quick reference
- Links to detailed docs

**AGENTS.md**
- Critical for understanding architecture
- Used by both humans and AI agents
- Too important to hide in subdirectory

**CHANGELOG.md**
- Standard location (expected in root)
- Follows Keep a Changelog convention
- Version history should be prominent

### Why Simplify README.md?

- Users shouldn't need to read 350+ lines to get started
- Detailed information belongs in dedicated guides
- Quick start should be actually quick (5 minutes)
- Links allow users to dive deeper as needed

### Why .vscode/ Folder?

- Standard VSCode convention
- Separates editor config from project files
- Clean root directory
- Better .gitignore handling

## Documentation Principles Applied

### 1. Avoid Redundancy
- Each topic covered in one place
- Cross-references instead of duplication
- Single source of truth per topic

### 2. Target Audience
- **README.md**: Everyone (quick reference)
- **docs/user-guide.md**: End users
- **docs/development.md**: Contributors
- **AGENTS.md**: Developers & AI agents

### 3. Progressive Disclosure
- README.md → High-level overview
- docs/ → Detailed information
- AGENTS.md → Deep architectural knowledge

### 4. Maintainability
- Clear ownership of content
- Easy to update without conflicts
- Documented structure in `DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md`

## Migration Notes

If you previously referenced documentation:

- `SETUP.md` → now `docs/development.md`
- Detailed config info → now `docs/user-guide.md`
- Architecture info → still `AGENTS.md`
- Version history → still `CHANGELOG.md`

## Summary

Successfully reorganized documentation following best practices:

✅ Root level: Brief README, architecture (AGENTS.md), changelog  
✅ docs/ folder: Comprehensive user and developer guides  
✅ No redundancy: Each topic in one place  
✅ Clear structure: Easy to find information  
✅ Maintainable: Clear ownership and update paths  
✅ Standard conventions: Follows open-source best practices  

The documentation is now well-organized, comprehensive, and maintainable!
